# escape-the-space
A video game in space where you have to find the way out

You can play the game at http://clemzd.github.io/escape-the-space/

- It still in development and quite unstable. 
- Just the first level is working for now (to win, you have to do nothing within 5 seconds)

I don't have a lot of time to work on it so feel free to PR.
